# Glorified Plumbing

This repository is intended to be a supplement to my blog
[Glorified Plumbing](https://glorifiedplumbing.blog).

The blog started as a way to support those I was mentoring in the field of embedded systems engineering.
It seemed I was giving the same advice multiple times, and I wanted to capture the knowledge in a place to share.

I really wanted a wiki, but Confluence is not cheap, and I did not identify a credible alternative. GitHub does allow you to add Wiki space to your repositories, but it does not have the smart-link features of Confluence.
With such limitations, a blog and website combination made more sense.


The samples will include not only traditional programming code samples, but also samples from the world of documentation and design.

Embedded engineering is not merely coding for embedded systems; it requires an understanding of the system as a whole, even including the human elements, such as communicating with stakeholders and fellow engineers, as well as making a user-friendly product.

Content will be added organically as blog posts and webpages are created.
