# Wavedrom

[Wavedrom](https://wavedrom.com) is a text-to-diagram tool that makes clean, crisp timing diagrams.

The diagrams included here are a mix of 

- samples from my book

- supporting examples for my blog

- starting templates for popular interfaces

## Usage

You’re welcome to use any of the diagrams in this repo.
No credit is required, though I’d really appreciate it.

If you’d like to see more examples or read about how I use PlantUML in embedded software debugging, check out my blog.

I don’t drink much coffee, but donations do help cover tool licenses and hosting fees.
